                      <p class="card-text">Web development refers to the creating, building, and maintaining of websites. It includes aspects such as web design, web publishing, web programming, and database management. It is the creation of an application that works over the internet i.e. websites.The word Web Development is made up of two words, that is:

                        Web: It refers to websites, web pages or anything that works over the internet.
                        Development: It refers to building the application from scratch.
                         
                        
                        Web Development can be classified into two ways:

                        Frontend Development
                        Backend Development
                        Frontend Development
                        The part of a website where the user interacts directly is termed as front end. It is also referred to as the ‘client side’ of the application. HTML: HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is used to design the front end portion of web pages using markup language. It acts as a skeleton for a website since it is used to make the structure of a website.
                        CSS: Cascading Style Sheets fondly referred to as CSS is a simply designed language intended to simplify the process of making web pages presentable. It is used to style our website.
                        JavaScript: JavaScript is a scripting language used to provide a dynamic behavior to our website.
                                                Backend Development
                        Backend is the server side of a website. It is part of the website that users cannot see and interact with. It is the portion of software that does not come in direct contact with the users. It is used to store and arrange data.

                      <h5 class="card-title"><i class="bi bi-filetype-html BIcon"></i>HTML</h5>
                              <p class="card-text"> HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the most basic building block of the Web. It defines the meaning and structure of web content. Other technologies besides HTML are generally used to describe a web page's appearance/presentation (CSS) or functionality/behavior (JavaScript)."Hypertext" refers to links that connect web pages to one another, either within a single website or between websites. Links are a fundamental aspect of the Web. By uploading content to the Internet and linking it to pages created by other people, you become an active participant in the World Wide Web.HTML uses "markup" to annotate text, images, and other content for display in a Web browser. HTML markup includes special "elements".
                                Forms are a very important part of the Web — these provide much of the functionality you need for interacting with websites, e.g. registering and logging in, sending feedback, buying products, and more. This module gets you started with creating the client-side/front-end parts of forms.HTML consists of elements, each of which may be modified by some number of attributes. HTML documents are connected to each other with links.Elements in HTML have attributes. These are additional values that configure the elements or adjust their behavior in various ways.
                                Global attributes may be specified on all HTML elements, even those not specified in the standard. This means that any non-standard elements must still permit these attributes, even though those elements make the document HTML5-noncompliant.

                      <p class="card-text"> CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a declarative language that controls how webpages look in the browser.

                        The browser applies CSS style declarations to selected elements to display them properly. A style declaration contains the properties and their values, which determine how a webpage looks.
                        
                        CSS is one of the three core Web technologies, along with HTML and JavaScript. CSS usually styles HTML elements, but can be also used with other markup languages like SVG or XML.
                        
                        A CSS rule is a set of properties associated with a selector. Here is an example that makes every HTML paragraph yellow against a black background:"Cascading" refers to the rules that govern how selectors are prioritized to change a page's appearance. This is a very important feature, since a complex website can have thousands of CSS rules.

                        A document is usually a text file structured using a markup language — HTML is the most common markup language, but you may also come across other markup languages such as SVG or XML.

Presenting a document to a user means converting it into a form usable by your audience. Browsers, like Firefox, Chrome, or Edge, are designed to present documents visually, for example, on a computer screen, projector, or printer.CSS can be used for very basic document text styling — for example, for changing the color and size of headings and links. It can be used to create a layout — for example, turning a single column of text into a layout with a main content area and a sidebar for related information.

                    But if you keep the purpose of a portfolio website in mind, the path to the finish line is a clearly guided process.

Sometimes this works but in many cases, it’s a poor implementation. To highlight your portfolio in another light, consider to include other key elements that will boost your portfolio’s user experience: case studies, testimonials, blog, and even a project you’re currently working on at the moment. </p>
